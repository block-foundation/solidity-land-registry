**Welcome to Block Foundation's Decentralized Land Registry project - an ambitious venture into the field of blockchain applications. This project is a part of our Smart Contract Series and leverages the full potential of Solidity, Ethereum's native programming language, to deliver a secure and transparent system for land transactions.***

## Introduction

Land registries have long been known for their lack of transparency and the potential for fraud, with numerous cases of illegal land acquisition and property disputes marring their history. Our solution, a Decentralized Land Registry, built on the foundation of blockchain technology, addresses these issues by providing a public, transparent, and immutable record of land transactions.

With our smart contract for the land registry system, an owner can register their land, update the land details, and even transfer ownership in a seamless and secure manner. Not only does this bring about a new level of trust and reliability to land transactions, but it also significantly reduces the potential for fraudulent activities.

This is an example of  a smart contract for a land registry system where an owner can register their land, update the land details, and even transfer ownership in a secure way. This contract makes land transactions more transparent and trustworthy.

The primary functionalities include:

1. Registration: When a user first registers a parcel of land, they are recorded as the owner of that parcel in the global state of the smart contract.

2. Land Update: The owner can update the details of their registered land. Any updates are recorded in the global state, ensuring that a history of changes is kept.

3. Ownership Transfer: If the owner decides to transfer their land, the contract allows for a seamless and secure transfer of ownership.

In addition, we've introduced enhanced features:

- Permissions: To prevent unauthorized users from registering or transferring land.
- Events: To keep track of every time a piece of land is registered or transferred.
- Sale functionality: Allows landowners to sell their land parcels.

This Decentralized Land Registry project is set to revolutionize how we view land transactions, bringing about a new level of transparency and security. We're excited to embark on this journey towards a more efficient, reliable, and secure system for land transactions, and we warmly invite you to explore, contribute, and grow with us in this endeavor.

## Quick Start

Before you dive in, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can then proceed to install the necessary dependencies:

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> To compile the smart contract:


``` sh
npm run compile
```

## Contract

This is a simple implementation and can be expanded to include more complex features, like adding permissions to prevent unauthorized people from registering or transferring land, or adding events to keep track of every time a piece of land is registered or transferred.

In this contract:

- `registerLand()` allows an address to register a new parcel of land with its location and a unique parcel ID. Emits a LandRegistered event when land is registered.
- `transferLand()` allows the current owner of a land parcel to transfer it to a new owner. Emits a LandTransferred event when land is transferred.
- `sellLand()` allows a landowner to sell their land to a buyer. This also involves the transfer of Ether (the currency on Ethereum) from the buyer to the seller, representing the payment for the land.
- `verifyLand()` allows anyone to verify the details of a land parcel.

Moreover:

- `price` on the `Land struct` handles selling land parcels.
- `onlyLandOwner` modifier to ensures that only the owner of a land parcel can perform certain actions.

*There is also a [PyTeal version](https://github.com/block-foundation/teal-land-registry) of this smart-contract, which offers similar functionality for the Algorand blockchain.*

## Background

### Evolving Land Management Systems

As we move deeper into the 21st century, traditional methods of managing land registries have proven to be insufficient, vulnerable to fraud, and fraught with red tape. In response, our project introduces a pioneering vision for the future of land management â€“ the Decentralized Land Registry. By marrying the infallible security of blockchain with the expansive realm of property management, we're reshaping how property transactions are executed and recorded. This transformative project strives to make property transactions as seamless and as transparent as possible, thereby fortifying trust among parties involved.

### Incorporating Advanced Technologies

Our Decentralized Land Registry project employs advanced technologies, such as Ethereum's blockchain and Solidity, to craft a robust and secure framework for land transactions. The project is part of our Smart Contract Series that aims to demonstrate how blockchain can revolutionize various sectors and industries. The contract allows landowners to register land parcels, update details, and transfer ownership in a tamper-proof, transparent, and efficient manner.

### A Step towards Greater Transparency

Transparency is the cornerstone of any trusted system. Our project ensures complete transparency in land transactions, thereby minimizing disputes and fraudulent activities. By recording transactions on the blockchain, we provide a public and immutable ledger, thus instilling a greater level of confidence in the process. As a result, the Decentralized Land Registry is set to change the way we perceive land transactions, ushering in a new era of trust, transparency, and efficiency.

### Open Source and Community Oriented

As an open-source project, the Decentralized Land Registry encourages community participation and contribution. We believe that the combined efforts and creativity of the global developer community can accelerate the evolution of our project and bring innovative solutions to the fore. We warmly welcome developers worldwide to join our mission, contribute to our codebase, and help us build a more transparent, efficient, and secure system for land transactions.
