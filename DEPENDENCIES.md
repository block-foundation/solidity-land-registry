## Package Dependencies

Package dependencies, or just regular dependencies are those packages that are needed for the
library code to run properly and so are are included as part of the library's final production bundle.

## Peer Dependencies

Peer dependencies are package dependencies that the library depends on
but are not included as part of the library's final production bundle.

Usually peer dependencies are packages that would-be users would already have or need
as part of their own applications, and hence, no need to include them as part of
the library code.



## Development Dependencies

Development dependencies are package dependencies used while developing library code
but are not part of the library's final production bundle.
