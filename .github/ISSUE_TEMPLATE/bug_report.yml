        Who wrote the feature?

        Because of the way this repository is configured, features authors do not get a notification when you create an issue.

        For the section above **@mention any author of the feature**. Authors' GitHub handle can be found on the main feature documentation page, under the "Solution" section.

        Issues without an @mention will be closed automatically, as authors won't get notified.

        **NOTE:** Don't @mention the repo maintainers, they already get notified.
