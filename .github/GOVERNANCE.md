## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-Based Approach

We follow a consensus-based decision-making process, where possible, to ensure that decisions reflect the collective opinion of the community.

1. **Discussion:** Contributors propose changes through GitHub issues, pull requests, or mailing lists. Discussions are encouraged to gather diverse perspectives.
   
2. **Proposal:** A formal proposal is made by creating a GitHub issue or pull request outlining the change and its rationale.
   
3. **Review:** Maintainers review the proposal, considering community feedback, technical feasibility, and alignment with the project's goals.
   
4. **Consensus:** Efforts are made to reach consensus among contributors. If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers make the final decision.
   
5. **Decision:** Once a decision is made, it is documented in the relevant issue or pull request.

### Voting

In cases where consensus cannot be reached, voting may be used to make a decision. Voting is conducted as follows:

- **Eligibility:** Voting is open to all maintainers.
- **Quorum:** At least 60% of maintainers must participate in the vote for it to be valid.
- **Outcome:** A simple majority is required for a decision to pass.
